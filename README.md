# Pyrats

This package can be used on top of [YT](https://yt-project.org/) to combine the outputs of [AdaptaHOP](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004MNRAS.352..376A/abstract) and [TreeMaker](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...506..647T/abstract).

It also comes with some matching routines.
